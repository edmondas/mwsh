[ About ]

This is a command line client for Microsoft SharePoint blog.
During first run you will need to provide blog url and username.
All information is stored in user's home directory (~/.mwshrc file)
For security reasons you will need to write your blog password 
everytime when you run this script. If you really really want to
save password then simply write it as password=PASSWORD to ~/.mwshrc
config file.

For XML parsing it uses slighty modified awk script by Steve Coile
http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/lib/awk/xmlparse.awk


[ Usage ]

Usage: ./mw.sh <command> [<post_id>]
All command list (and aliases) you can see by running this script without any argument.


[ Examples ] 

to get blog information:
./mw.sh info

To create new blog post:
./mw.sh new

To remove blog post (using alias to remove):
./mw.sh rm

To get specific post (passing post id from command line):
./mw.sh get 1
